Q&A
You mean that, in parent pom i should declare all the dependencies within <dependencies> tag, not within <depenedencyManagement> or in child pom? I have put all the dependencies within <depenedencyManagement> tags in parent pom. Is that a problem? – Cherry Aug 10 '16 at 19:56
  	 	
If you goal is to inherit particular dependencies to all child poms, without a need to decleare them in each of the children - then yes, you should declare them within <dependencies> and not <dependencyManagement>. On the other hand, a dependency declared within <dependencyManagement> can be used only when you need it in a child pom - you just write its group and artifact inside that child's <dependencies>. The benefit being that other properties (version) are declared only once in the parent.
